# Contributing to dbt-remote

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Setup

### Environment
To set up the project, we recommend using Poetry since it will be required for changes submission and publication. The steps are the following:

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install poetry** ([installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))
3. At the root of the project, **run**:
```shell
poetry lock -n; poetry install;
```
Poetry should install the right packages (listed in ```pyproject.toml```).

Export the project ID and location of your dbt-server
```shell
export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
export LOCATION=<LOCATION>
```

### Deploy the dbt-server
Follow the dbt-server deployment instructions here: [dbt-server deployment guide](../dbt_server/README.md)

### Run end-to-end tests to make sure everyting is properly setup
This should take a few minutes.
```shell
poetry run pytest tests -log_cli=true -log_cli_level=info -vvv --maxfail=1
```

This makes sure that you are able to properly push images on the remote Docker registry, and that dbt commands run as expected.

Once everything here is green, your are good to go.
## **Development workflow**

### Running the server locally
This is useful to reduce turnaround time during developement as you will not necessarily have to build a new image and deploy a new Cloud Run instance.

**You still need to have deployed the dbt-server once on GCP as there are resources that are needed even for local serving**

Make sure the necessary env vars are available. If you deployed the dbt-server resources using the default names:
```shell
export LOCAL=true
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=dbt-server-service-account@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
export BUCKET_NAME=${PROJECT_ID}-dbt-server
export DOCKER_IMAGE=${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/dbt-server-repository/server-image
export ARTIFACT_REGISTRY=${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/dbt-server-repository
```

Start the dbt-server locally:
```shell
poetry run python3 dbt_server/dbt_server.py
```
```shell
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [64101] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [64110]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**While the dbt-server code is executed locally, the actual dbt execution still happens in a cloud run job based on the docker image in your GCP project. Make sure to push a new image if you make any changes that affect it during development.**
```shell
poetry run python3 dbt_remote/cli.py image submit
```

You should now be able to call it:
```shell
poetry run python3 dbt_remote/cli.py debug --project-dir tests/dbt_project --server-url http://localhost:8001/
```
```shell
[...]
INFO    [dbt] Registered adapter: bigquery=1.6.8
INFO    [dbt]   Connection test: [OK connection ok]  
INFO    [dbt] All checks passed!
INFO    [job] Command successfully executed
INFO    [job] dbt-remote job finished
```

## Publishing a new package version
----------------
## **Workflow for working on the dbt-remote**

To build and install your own version of the package, you can run (at the root of the project):

```sh
poetry build
poetry run pip install dist/gcp_dbt_remote-X.Y.Z.tar.gz # <-- change X.Y.Z by your version
dbt-remote --help
```

## Test the project

### **Test the dbt-server**

```sh
cd dbt_server
poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

All tests should pass by your will get a TypeError due to ```google.cloud.logging.Worker```. Bug to fix.

> Note: Since some Google libraries raise many DeprecationWarning errors regarding namespace packages, you may want to add ```-W ignore::DeprecationWarning``` to your command

### **Test dbt-remote**

```sh
poetry run pytest dbt_remote/tests/unit
```

The ```dbt_remote/tests/integration``` contains one file with integration tests but it is not finished and it needs to be reviewed.

## Report a bug

**Before submitting a bug report**

Check the troubleshooting section in the README.

**Submit a bug report**

Explain the problem as clearly as possible and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem. Ex:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. If possible, include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Specify your environment (which version of the tool you are using, which OS, packages versions)
- If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.


## Submit changes

This section describes the procedure for submitting any type of change, be it a bug fix or a new feature.

### Before submitting a change

Take a look at the project guidelines in [dbt-remote project page](index.md) to make sure your change is aligned with the project.

### Submitting a change

- Explain your change: Give a precise description of what you would change in the project behavior and why it would be useful

- Validate the change with the owners

- Code your change following the [coding convention](#coding-convention)

- Create a PR and wait for validation

### Publishing a change

>**First contribution**
> Create an account on Pypi (or TestPypi). Get your Pypi token. Ask Emma Galli√®re to add you as collaborator on the project

- **If not done yet**, add Test Pypi as repository
```sh
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

- Check the tests pass:
```sh
poetry run pytest dbt_remote/tests/unit/
```
and
```sh
cd dbt_server; poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

- Increment the package version in `pyproject.toml`

- Build the package
```sh
poetry build
```

- Publish the package
```sh
token=$(cat <your-pypi-token.txt>)
poetry publish --repository testpypi -u __token__ -p $token --skip-existing
```

### Coding convention

- Follow Clean Code good practices as much as possible
- Be vigilant with your naming convention (variable, functions, etc.) so that it is as clear as possible
- Add type hinting for every function
- ...

**Dependencies:** you can't change dbt-bigquery version without discussing it with the team for retro compatibility reasons. For other dependencies, make sure all the tests pass before submitting your change.
